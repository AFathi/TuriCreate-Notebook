# Raw Python Examples
This directory provides you with Python examples to try [**Turi Create**](https://github.com/apple/turicreate) and create machine learning models using the Python package.

Additionally, there is a folder in this repository named `data` located in the [`notebooks`](https://github.com/AFathi/turicreate-notebooks/tree/master/notebooks) directory that contains the sample datasets used in the examples.

Note:- Please make sure to extract the `food_images.zip` and change the file paths in the Python code before running examples that require files from the `data` folder.

## How to run Python?
After following the [instructions to download](https://github.com/AFathi/turicreate-notebooks/blob/master/README.md#install--setup) the required software, you will need to do the following to test the examples:
