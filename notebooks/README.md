# Python Notebook Examples
This directory provides you with Jupyter Notebook examples to try [**Turi Create**](https://github.com/apple/turicreate) and create custome machine learning models using the Python package.

Additionally, there is a folder in this directory named `data` that contains the sample datasets used in the examples.

**Note**:- Please make sure to extract the `food_images.zip` before running the image classification examples.
