# Turi Create Notebooks
This repository's main purpose is explaining what [Turi Create](https://github.com/apple/turicreate) is, how to install it, and how to use it. Additionally, I'm providing a few [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org) examples that demonstrate different uses of the Python package.

Also, in this **README** file, I will explain how to setup `Python`, `pip`, and install the `turicreate` package on your machine.

## What is Turi Create?
In the [Turi Create](https://github.com/apple/turicreate) official repository, they describe it as a library that:
>simplifies the development of custom machine learning models. You don't have to be a machine learning expert to add recommendations, object detection, image classification, image similarity or activity classification to your app.

From a point of view of an iOS developer with some background in machine learning, I'd describe it as a library that takes away all the required complex mathematical computation to create a machine learning model.

A machine learning model created using **Turi Create** can easily be exported as a [Core ML](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml) model and be implemented into iOS, macOS, tvOS or watchOS applications.

## Why use Turi Create?
In the past few years, the use of machine learning approaches to solve problems and perform complex tasks have been increasing. Machine learning enable us to use big data rather than writing millions of lines of code to perform complex tasks, such as image classification.

Machine learning still has a long way ahead to improve and perform better; however, it's currently good enough for production-level applications. 

Before **Turi Create**, it would be very challenging and time consuming for software developers to create a machine learning model and run it on mobile devices. In order to run a machine learning model on an iPhone or iPad, you would have to optimize your model, which is a very complicated procedure. 

However, thanks to Apple, now we have both **Turi Create** and **CoreML** that enable us to easily create machine learning models for Apple devices. Turi Create provides us with essential machine learning algorithms, such as k-nearest neighbor, to integrate it with other advanced algorithms in order to create a production-ready machine learning model.

In this repository, I will be demonstrating how to create useful machine learning models that may many uses in your existing and future applications!
