# Turi Create Notebooks
This repository's main purpose is explaining what [Turi Create](https://github.com/apple/turicreate) is, how to install it, and how to use it. Additionally, I'm providing a few [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org) examples that demonstrate different uses of the Python package.

Also, in this **README** file, I will explain how to setup `Python`, `pip`, and install the `turicreate` package on your machine.
